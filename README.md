# Volcanoes Project

A simple simulation of the main types of volcanoes.

## Features

* Dynamic eruption that interacts with various scenery like trees and houses
* Stratovolcano, shield volcano, and cinder cone if I have time
* Simulated pyroclastic and lava flows
    * Possibly mud slides too
* Information about the volcano and the damage it can cause
